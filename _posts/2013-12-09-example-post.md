##Working Together != Easy

Our weekend coding project of building a working version of battleship turned out a failure. It was not because we simply did not do it, due to laziness or some sense of apathy. There were other factors at work, some deserve their own articulation.

*Team Work*
At this point in our coding career, I would say that writing sensible, well-organized, dry and flexible code is hard enough as it is. That being said, I would venture that all of us would have been able to implement battleship as a terminal game on our own. Yet this was not the point of the exercise. The central component of this project was its status as a team project, and as we quickly came to find out, this came with its own set of difficulties. 

Using the Model-Views-Controller paradigm, one tries to separate different functionalities into different modules. Our brilliant notion was to simply have each person work on one module, and once completed, connect them nicely to each other, and voila, the project is complete. Wrong. 

Connecting code via modules is very much like connecting two wires: the plug on one end has to match the shape of the receiving end. I doubt when they developed the male/female plug design, they put one half of the engineers on the male project, and the other half on the female project in hopes that both would produce the same shape so that they could miraculously connect the two ends when both teams are done. 

What that team clearly needed was a mediator, a person supervising the progress of both teams and fostering communication between the two. An added bonus would be a person with some understanding of the finished product, such that they can delegate tasks that still needed to be finished. 

Our mistake was thinking that this connection of modules would handle itself. This is why industry spends an inordinate amount of resources on management: teams require supervision. It has nothing to do with encouraging work and boosting productivity, it is more about focus. The reason why a professional orchestra needs a professional conductor is not because each individual musician does not play their music well. Rather, the conductor unifies each member to play a cohesive piece of music, together. Our project was lacking a conductor.

I would propose this person write very little code themselves, and focus only on reading the code already completed, trying to merge modules across our paradigm and most importantly, *delegate tasks* to the coders so that they know *exactly* what they need to do. 

Other factors notwithstanding, I venture this was the central issue. We had 700 lines of code that didn't harmonize. We were a symphony without a conductor, a group of musicians playing their own music in the same room. That is precisely what people call a cacophony.
