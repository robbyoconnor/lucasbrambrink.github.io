##Objects and their Orientation

Python is a very interesting language. The most encouraging aspect of python is that expert programmers consider it "not the complete worst" and "not entirely terrible", so there must be something to it. It has a powerful standard library, features dynamic compiling, and most importantly supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming.

Objected-oriented programming integrates code and data using the concept of an "object", which has state (data) and behavior (code). OOP encourages programmers to place data where it is not directly accessible by the rest of the system. It comes with a lot of advantages that I encourage the reader to research, as I will not spell them out here. Nontrivially, it generally affords cleaner code that is easier to read.

It is no simple task to write good OO, therefore it is to the advantage of any programmer to dive into the concept and do some exercises. Being prompted with a classic introductory exercise of writing the software for a coffee maker. Since a coffee maker is sufficently complicated yet also entirely managable, it is well suited for a design exercise. 

The student can ask himself, how does the coffee maker progress from "no coffee" to "coffee!"; what are the different hardware components at work, and how do they need to be engaged, checked and communicated with to achieve the making of coffee. Coding this properly is no easy task.

One major mistake one can make is to confuse the flow of information with the flow of physical components. We must define our objects according to sensible data architecture, conceptually divorcing them from their physical counterpart.
